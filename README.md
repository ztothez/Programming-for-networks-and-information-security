## Overview

This repository contains Python exercises and small applications focused on networking and information security use cases.

The material moves from core Python fundamentals to practical automation tasks such as working with structured data, interacting with APIs, and handling network-related information.

The emphasis is on understanding how Python supports network operations and security workflows rather than building production-ready systems.

## Included Areas

* Python fundamentals applied to networking scenarios
* File handling and structured data processing
* JSON and XML parsing
* REST API interaction
* Basic asynchronous programming
* Small network automation examples (including APIC-EM)
* Simple visualization of API data

## Repository Structure

### Activity/

Core learning exercises covering:

* Variables, lists, dictionaries, functions
* Control flow
* File input/output
* JSON and XML parsing
* Basic error handling

### Async Code/

Examples demonstrating asynchronous execution for network-bound tasks using `asyncio`.

### Build A Python Application/

Small applied scripts combining multiple concepts, including:

* Weather and sunrise/sunset API clients
* ISS tracking examples
* Cisco APIC-EM automation scripts

### SampleCode/

Minimal reference snippets for common tasks such as JSON, XML, file handling, and data structures.

### SampleApps/

Small, self-contained programs built from earlier exercises.

### Test/

Input files used by selected scripts for file and error-handling practice.

## Use Cases

* Learning Python with a networking focus
* Practicing structured data handling
* Understanding API-driven automation
* Supporting network and security lab environments
* Building foundational automation skills
  
## Tech

* Python 3.8+
* requests
* asyncio
* JSON / XML standard libraries

Install dependency when required:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Run example:

```bash
python Activity/example_script.py
```

## Positioning

This repository is intentionally structured as a learning and experimentation environment.

The scripts are small by design. They are meant to build foundational understanding of automation concepts that can later scale into larger network or security tooling.
